    "title": "Phone price classification with machine learning",
    "description": "Picking the price of a mobile phone is not an easy task, especially if you are neither the producer of the phone nor the first hand vendor. Therefore, there is a need to distinguish a way of finding the appropriate price for each mobile phone device. In general each mobile phone can be assigned to one of these four price ranges: low, medium, high, and very high. Moreover, each mobile phone comes with a set of features and specifications such as the RAM memory, CPU, front and back camera quality, and so on. All these features play a role in determining the mobile phoneâ€™s price range. In this project, machine learning techniques will be applied to try and make predictions about the price range of a phone. Various classification techniques, artificial neural networks and hybrid models will be trained and tested using a dataset which is provided by a shop owner and contains the information about the above mentioned features and their corresponding price ranges. All the models will be trained with different normalized versions of the dataset and with different parameters or structures (in case of MLP, Ensembles) to see in which conditions they perform better. The aim of the project is to find: Under which normalization and feature engineering each model works the best Which model has the best accuracy at predicting price ranges The models with better accuracy can then be utilized for the prediction of the price range of real life mobile phones by simply providing their features.",

    "title": "Movie recommendation system",
    "description": "This is a project with focus on recommendation systems and how they function. The information used is based on the movie dataset provided by kaggle which can be found at the link in resources section. The program designed is a hybrid recommendation system which employs both collaborative filtering and content filtering. This is manifested in the two main features of the program which are providing a personal recommendation and providing trending recommendations. To provide personal recommendation the system relies on previous movies the user has interacted with to generate a list of similar movies from the dataset using cosine similarity. For each movie in the interaction list about 35 similar movies are picked and the recommendation is created by taking the intersection of each movie list. This way the user is likely to get movies that he will enjoy. On the other hand, to provide the trending recommendation the system relies on the interaction list of each user. It generates the personal recommendation of each user and then takes the intersaction of the personal recommendations. On the next version of the system this feature will be updated so that the first 10 movies on each personal recommendation are joined an the other movies are intersected to create the final trending recommendation.Since the system currently has the goal of simply simulating a hybrid recommendation system, the interaction of the user with the movies is minimal. The user can search for the movies and put them in his interaction list by pressing like. In the next version of the app the dislike feature will also be provided. The application currently maintains states of previous recommendations. This is done because creating a new recommendation is a time-consuming task so it should be avoided if the interaction lists of users have not changed in a while.",
